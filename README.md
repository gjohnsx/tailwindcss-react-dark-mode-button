# Getting Started 

This dark mode switcher uses state and useEffect to check whether a user preference exists. If so, it displays dark mode. If not, it will default to dark mode.

The Button in the Nav component uses a custom animation defined in tailwind.config.js and gets passed the dark mode state along with animation and dark mode setters.
